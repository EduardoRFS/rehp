 * This process "prepares" Rehp for transformation into PHP.  Why not just
 * perform that preparation during the transform to PHP? Because some of the
 * transformation has to be done before lexical analysis/linking is performed.
 * See the diagram above.
 * The linker needs to know what is in scope/free to determine what to link in.
 * This preparation phase turns all of the special Rehp AST nodes into "user
 * space" function calls when possible. That means that Php_from_rehp only has
 * to deal with a more limited subset of Rehp that corresponds to ordinary
 * identifiers / scope.
 * Anything that manipulates terms and analyzes scope should probably be done
 * after coloring because coloring adds functions. That's why Php_from_rehp
 * also does some lexical scope analysis/transformations.
